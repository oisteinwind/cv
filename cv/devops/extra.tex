I live in Trekroner near Roskilde with my wife Lea and my two sons, Aksel (6 years) and Vigge (4 years). In my spare time I enjoy exercising by running and doing yoga. I am an avid artisan baker and also enjoy cooking. Occasionally, I brew beer although the results are of varying quality. Sometimes, however, spending time on the couch is what I prefer and Peaky Blinders along with House of Cards has been my preferred pastime. I live in a community (bofællesskab) along with 27 families where we share common spaces and a common house and take turn cooking for the rest of the families four days each week. I am a member of the board in our community. I enjoy this way of living as it entails a very good combination of social and private life.

%  %most notably are Counter Strike, World of Warcraft, Heroes of Newerth, and most recently Heroes of the Storm. 
%  While other activities are taking most of my time I still enjoy the occasional LAN with my friends.
